	<p>This season has been quite interesting for Chelsea fans. Top of the table with a seven point margin. A team which is highly coordinated and lethal. A manager which has struck a cord with the player and the fanbase. Antonio Conte has turned a fatigued and inconsistent Chelsea side into a juggernaut who are well balanced in both defence and attack. </p>

	<p>Many fans, including myself, are quite surprised when we see what is happening at the West London club at the moment. After Jose Mourinho was sacked last season, the fans went out all against the board for making the same mistake a second time. And why wouldn't they? Jose Mourinho was the one manager Chelsea fans loved. Mourinho and Chelsea complimented each other in the best manner possible. It was a love story which seemed to last forever when he came back to Chelsea after touring all over Europe.</p>

	<p>However it was not to be. The cruelty of football is such that it has really low patience. It does not wit for anyone, be it any lower league manager or be it some one as good as Jose Mourinho.</p>

	<p id="Conte">In comes ANTONIO CONTE.</p>

	<p>There was a doubt whether the Italian would be able to change the club for the better. It was not that he was not successful but, the Premier League is by far the most competitive league in the world where lower ranked teams can beat the top clubs on any given day. </p>

	<p>It did not start well for the Italian with losses to Liverpool and Arsenal in the first few weeks of the season. There were also reports that he might be sacked (yes that's how crazy the game is!)</p>

	<p>But, since he employed the 3-4-3 which the Italian is famous for, it has been a joy ride for the Blues.</p>

	<p>He brought with him not only his tactics, but an intensity and passion which was missing under Mourinho. He is tough, but not without reason. That what makes him different and better suited to the high expectations of Chelsea.</p>

	<p>Chelsea fan from Ireland, Thomas Smith says, 'Last season under Mourinho, he kind of lost his players.</p>

	<p id="Thomas">'CONTE HAS REALLY TURNED THEM AROUND. HE IS EXTREMELY PASSIONATE.</p>

	<p>He got the players gelled together again. Absolutely delighted to see us at the top of the league.'</p>

	<p>I visited the Stamford Bridge on the 2nd of April, a day after they lost a match to Crystal Palace and talked to some Chelsea fans who were seemed quite positive about this season regardless of the defeat.</p>

	<p>Ahmad Shahir, who came all the way from Malaysia to see a Chelsea game believes that the team in the last season. He said, 'They did not want to play for the coach (Mourinho).Once Mourinho left, it was a different team with the same players.'</p>

	<p id="Ahmed">'IT HAS TO DO WITH CONTE BEING AN EX-PLAYER. BEING AN EX-PLAYER HE KNOWS HOW PLAYERS FEEL. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE!</p>

	<p>It was quite evident that Mourinho lost the dressing room because his tactics were quite becoming regressive and players like Eden Hazard was unhappy with the role he was given.</p>

	<p>Under Conte the free role given to Hazard is paying dividends the team looks balanced. The back three has been one of the strongest in the league which kept 13 clean sheets when Chelsea went on a winning run.</p>

	<p>You have to see Conte on the sidelines. He is enigmatic, and never rests. Till the last minute he is shouting instructions at the players. He has been able to stable the ship left by the disgruntled Portuguese.</p>

	<p>In his first season at the Premier League, this was not foreseen. More so because managers like Pep Guardiola has not been able to settle well. His Manchester City started off great but became inconsistent and Guardiola is looking at not finishing outside the top two for the first time in his career.</p>

	<p>Jack, another Chelsea fan said, 'Last season Mourinho lost the dressing room. This season Conte has brought a new way of playing, different formation which has caught teams off guard.'</p>

	<p id="Mourinho">There always was a shadow of Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, but it now being challenged by Anotnio Conte.</p>

	<p>Mourinho was the one who is the most successful till date. He was passionate about Chelsea. That is what made him a fan's favourite at the club.</p>

	<img id="endpic" src="Images/rsz_img_1906.jpg" border="3"/>

	<p>But now, he as been replaced by a man who is not equally vocal and equally ruthless. But trophies counts for most at Chelsea without which no one can survive the wrath of owner Roman Abramovich. With how things are going now, Conte looks in a brilliant position to keep his job and also stay at the club for a long time.</p>

	<p id="lastline">Will he be able to emulate and even replace Jose's legacy at the Bridge? Only time will tell.</p>
